# QnA_System
# Q\&A System

## Overview

Welcome to the Q\&A System! This project shows how to build a question-answering (QA) pipeline in two simple steps:

1. **Retriever**: Imagine you have a huge library of books and you need to find the right pages with the answers. The retriever searches through many documents and picks out the most relevant snippets.
2. **Generator**: Once you have the right snippets, the generator reads them and writes a clear, friendly answer—just like a teacher explaining to a class.

By splitting the problem into these parts, we make the system fast, accurate, and easy to maintain.

## How It Works (for a 12‑year‑old)

1. **Library Helper (Retriever)**: Think of your computer as a helper that quickly flips through pages of many books and collects only the pages that might have your answer.
2. **Storyteller (Generator)**: Your computer then reads those pages and tells you the answer in a way that’s easy to understand—like turning facts into a short, clear story.
3. **Why Two Parts?**

   * The helper avoids showing you hundreds of pages you don’t need.
   * The storyteller makes sure you get a neat, friendly answer instead of a big jumble of text.

## Files in This Repo

* `QnA_System.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with all the code steps, data loading, model training, and evaluation.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists Python libraries you need (e.g., `transformers`, `faiss`, `nltk`).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QnA_System.git
   cd QnA_System
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\\Scripts\\activate  # Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook QnA_System.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run each cell** in order:

   * Load and preprocess documents
   * Build or load the retriever (using embeddings + similarity search)
   * Build or load the generator (fine-tuned language model)
   * Evaluate the system with precision, recall, and BLEU scores

3. **Ask your own questions** by modifying the notebook’s test section.

## Evaluation Metrics

* **Precision (Retriever)**: Out of all the pages the system found, how many actually had the right answer?
  *Formula: TP / (TP + FP)*

* **Recall (Retriever)**: Out of all the pages that should have been found, how many did the system actually find?
  *Formula: TP / (TP + FN)*

* **BLEU (Generator)**: How close is the generated answer to the real answer on a scale from 0 to 1?

* **Overall Score**: The average of Precision, Recall, and BLEU. This gives one number to compare different versions.

---

## Next Steps

* Try different retriever models (e.g., dense vs. sparse embeddings).
* Fine-tune the generator on your own Q\&A data.
* Experiment with more documents to see how it scales!
